    "content": "# Raiden Shogun Complete Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nRaiden Shogun, also known as Ei, is a 5-star Electro Polearm character from Inazuma.

Use Raiden's Elemental Skill before switching to teammates\n2. Build energy on teammates, then use their bursts\n3. Switch to Raiden and use her burst when ready\n4. During burst, focus on Normal Attacks (not Charged)\n5. Repeat the rotation\n\n## Talent Priority\n\nElemental Burst > Elemental Skill > Normal Attack\n\n## Constellation Value\n\nC0 is perfectly viable. C2 is her biggest power spike (Ignores 60% of DEF).

    "content": "# Beginner's Guide to Team Building\n\n## Understanding Team Roles\n\nEvery successful team in Genshin Impact needs a balance of different roles:\n\n### 1. Main DPS\n- Character that stays on-field the most\n- Deals majority of damage\n- Examples: Hu Tao, Itto, Ayaka\n\n### 2. Sub DPS\n- Provides off-field damage\n- Supports the main DPS\n- Examples: Xingqiu, Fischl, Xiangling\n\n### 3. Support\n- Provides buffs, healing, or shields\n- Enables team to survive and deal more damage\n- Examples: Bennett, Zhongli, Kazuha\n\n## Elemental Reactions\n\nUnderstanding reactions is key to team building:\n\n### Amplifying Reactions\n- **Vaporize** (Hydro + Pyro): 1.5x or 2x multiplier\n- **Melt** (Cryo + Pyro): 1.5x or 2x multiplier\n\n### Transformative Reactions\n- **Overloaded** (Pyro + Electro): AoE Pyro damage\n- **Electro-Charged** (Electro + Hydro): Chain lightning\n- **Superconduct** (Electro + Cryo): Reduces Physical RES\n- **Swirl** (Anemo + Element): Spreads element\n\n## Sample F2P Team\n\n**National Team**\n- Xiangling / Xingqiu / Bennett / Flex (Chongyun/Sucrose)\n- Uses only 4-star characters\n- Very powerful and accessible\n- Great for all content\n\n## Tips for New Players\n\n1. Focus on building one team at a time\n2. Invest in supports - they work in multiple teams\n3. Don't spread resources too thin\n4. Level weapons and talents, not just characters\n5. Artifacts become important at AR45+\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- Building too many DPS characters\n- Ignoring elemental reactions\n- Not using supports effectively\n- Neglecting weapon upgrades"

    "content": "# Artifact Farming Optimization Guide\n\n## When to Start Farming\n\n**Wait until AR45** before seriously farming artifacts. At AR45, you unlock the highest difficulty domains that guarantee a 5-star artifact per run.\n\n## Domain Priority\n\n### Top Priority Domains\n\n1. **Momiji-Dyed Court** (Inazuma)\n   - Emblem of Severed Fate\n   - Shimenawa's Reminiscence\n   - Both sets are universally useful\n\n2. **Valley of Remembrance** (Mondstadt)\n   - Viridescent Venerer\n   - Essential for Anemo supports\n\n3. **Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula** (Liyue)\n   - Crimson Witch of Flames\n   - Best for Pyro DPS\n\n## Main Stat Priority\n\n### Sands (3rd slot)\n- DPS: ATK%\n- Support: Energy Recharge or Elemental Mastery\n- HP Scalers: HP%\n\n### Goblet (4th slot)\n- Elemental DMG% for most DPS\n- ATK% acceptable if no DMG% available\n\n### Circlet (5th slot)\n- CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG for DPS\n- Healing Bonus for healers\n\n## Substat Priority\n\n**For DPS:**\n1. CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG\n2. ATK%\n3. Energy Recharge\n4. Elemental Mastery\n\n**Aim for 1:2 ratio** (CRIT Rate : CRIT DMG)\nExample: 70% CRIT Rate, 140% CRIT DMG\n\n## Resin Efficiency Tips\n\n1. Use condensed resin (40 resin = 2 runs worth)\n2. Farm domains that give 2 useful sets\n3. Don't chase perfect artifacts\n4. Know when 'good enough' is enough\n5. Use Strongbox for off-set pieces\n\n## Strongbox System\n\nConvert unwanted 5-star artifacts into:\n- Noblesse Oblige\n- Gladiator's Finale\n- Wanderer's Troupe\n- Bloodstained Chivalry\n\n## What Makes a 'Good' Artifact?\n\n- Correct main stat\n- 2-3 good substats\n- Substats roll into CRIT stats\n\nDon't expect perfect artifacts - they're extremely rare!"
